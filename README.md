# python-mini-projects
collection of simple small Python projects I built 
while learning this programming language.
These projects helped me practice core python concepts like 
variables, functions, loops, conditionals and file handling.


## 1. Calculator with History
   A simple calculator that supports basic operations
   (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
   Keeps the history of previous calculations, also allows 
   clearing history when needed.

 #Concept used: functions, loops, file handling, exception handling

## 2. Password Strength Checker
   Takes password as input and checks if it is "strong", "medium" 
   or "weak".
   Validate based on length, presence of digits, uppercase,
   lowercase and special characters.

   A program of to-do-list app where you can-
  * Add tasks
  * Mark tasks as done
  * Delete tasks
  * View all tasks

#Concept used: lists, functions, loops, conditionals


## To Run these Projects

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soni-K30/python-mini-projects.git

2. go to the project folder on your vs code.
3. run the project, in the terminal type-
   ```bash
   python calculatorwithhistory.py
(Replace with todolist.py, passwordstrengthchecker.py, or pythonquiz.py for other projects.)
